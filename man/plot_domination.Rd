plot_domination(
  x,
  axis = NULL,

  relative = TRUE,
  title = "Dominance Plot",
  width = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object returned by \code{\link{metagam}}.}

\item{axis}{Character specifying which variable to plot. Defaults to \code{NULL}; if \code{x} was
fitted with a single term, the explanatory variable corresponding to this term
is selected.}

\item{term}{Character specifying which smooth term to plot. Default to \code{NULL}; if \code{x}
was fitted with a single term, this one is taken.}

\item{relative}{Logical specifying whether to have relative or absolute scales.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{title}{Title of plot.}

\item{width}{Width of bars. Default to \code{NULL}, which means it is automatically
